# Intrepid-Potash

I conducted multiple linear regression model tests to find significant correlations for Intrepid Potash's company data,
which is helping management make key decisions on improving their production line. 

The project is ongoing, and therefore the RMD file is not finished. The RMD file is portraying the data wrangling skills I am using to help solve questions for the Intrepid Potash.
