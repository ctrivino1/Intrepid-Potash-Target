# Intrepid-Potash

The project is no longer ongoing.

Intrepid Potash is a company that Intrepid delivers high quality potassium, magnesium, sulfur and salt essential for success in agriculture, animal feed and industry. They were interested in finding correlations in their production line to see if they improve their production line with any insights. They reached out to Brigham Young University-Idaho's data science society to help them get started.

I was involved in a team where we discovered some insights and some problems with their data. My role in my team was to create a linear regression model that could help the company find insights. 


The following  link contains the information and insights I was able to present to the company.
